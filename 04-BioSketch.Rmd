__Synergistic Activities__ \hrulefill

_1) Undergraduate and Graduate Student Mentoring_

> Mentored one undergraduate student in the Colllege of Arts and Science at the University of Chicago, guiding them in the design, execution, and analysis of experiments that are a central part of a manuscript pending submission. Mentored three female graduate students (one Ph.D. Candidate, one rotation Ph.D. student, one visiting Masters student), assisting them in the design and methodology of their projects, and in the downstream analysis of results. Research alongside the Ph.D. Candidate and the Masters student have lead to manuscripts-in-progress, to be published in the near future. 

_2) Scientific Outreach and Communications_

> Presented research findings in 4 major national and international conferences, including once with honors. Interviewed by Ira Flatow on _Science Friday_ in the segment "How A ‘Zombie Gene’ Helped Elephants Evolve Protection From Cancer." Participated in scientific workshops and public demonstrations for 5 years at the Museum of Science and Industry and the Field Museum. Chaired an international conference (2019 Biology of Aging Gordon Research Seminar) and two regional meetings (2018 and 2019 Midwest Regional SACNAS Conferences). 
  
_3) Leadership in Broadening Participation of Underrepresented Groups in STEM_

> Treasurer (1 year) and President (2 years) of the University of Chicago chapter of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in STEM (UCSACNAS). Organized monthly professional and personal development events for underrepresented groups at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate level. Awarded the Chapter Role Model Award for Professional Development and Chapter of the Year Award from the National SACNAS organization in recognition of our extraordinary programming. Won 4 grants totaling $31,000 for Diversity and Inclusion initiatives in Chicago and the Midwest. Organized 2 Midwest regional conferences for personal and professional development and research presentations targeted at underrepresented groups at the undergraduate and graduate level. Helped organize and teach a half-semester class for computational biology at a majority-minority high school. Part of a 4-person committee tasked with designing the procedures for selecting a student representative for the nascent Diversity and Inclusion Committee at the University of Chicago. Participated in 3 panels focused on the experiences of underrepresented minorities in STEM, and how they navigated life through their PhDs. Helped organize and lead 3 day-long laboratory tour and journal club events with high school students from majority-minority high schools at the University of Chicago. Co-founded _A Scientist Like YOU_, an Instagram and YouTube channel which hosts weekly takeovers by scientists of color, who showcase their work and daily lives to allow underrepresented groups to see themselves in our shoes. 

_3) Training and Experiences in Pedagogy_

> Over 600 hours of tutoring experience, including teaching at the middle and high school level. Participated in various panels on leadership and executive functioning skills targeted to underrepresented groups in high school and the undergraduate level. At both the undergraduate and the graduate level, have taken various courses on pedagogy, inclusive teaching, and course design, with practical applications in lectures and discussion sections. Nominated for teaching assistant prizes by students in each of the 4 classes I have ever assisted and taught. 

_4) Training in Leadership and Mentoring_

> Participated and enrolled in classes for managing teams of scientists, starting and administering labs, and mentoring students in the classroom and in lab.
