# RESEARCH INTERESTS \hrulefill

From single-celled prokaryotes to mammals, lifespan is one of the most diverse and omniprescent life history traits. Aging is both implicated in and affected by a number of biological processes at all scales of life; yet our understanding of the genetics and directionality of aging-associated traits is limited in scope. The advent of cost-effective genomics at tree-of-life scale has enabled new frontiers in the study of aging using comparative biology. My work focuses on tackling interdisciplinary questions aging with equally interdisciplinary approaches, ranging from cellular and molecular biology to comparative evolutionary genomics and population genetics. I am currently developing a system for the study of the evolution of longevity-associated traits in bats using modern functional genomics by generating chromomesome-scale genomes, primary cell lines, and induced pluripotent stem cells for over 10 species of closely-related bats with a diversity of lifespans. This system will enable us to not only identify genes and regulatory pathways associated with the evolution of increased or decreased longevity; but also understand how the mechanisms behind these findings in a native context.
