# RESEARCH INTERESTS \hrulefill

I have always been fascinated by aging and cancer; in particular, I am interested in the genetic and epigenetic basis underlying the wide diversity in lifespans across mammals. I have worked on the evolution of stress response and cancer resistance using comparative genomics and _ex vivo_ primary cell culture in large and/or long-lived species, including the African Elephant, Bowhead Whale, and the Naked Mole Rat. Current projects include studing the genetics underlying changes in chromatin and gene expression with age in mice using multimodal single cell sequencing; and studying the evolution of lifespan and genome stability in bats using evolutionary and population genetics frameworks.
