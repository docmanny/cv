# RESEARCH INTERESTS \hrulefill

I have always been fascinated by aging and cancer; in particular, I am interested in the genetic and epigenetic basis underlying the wide diversity in lifespans across mammals. I study how large and/or long-lived species, such as African Elephants, the Bowhead Whale, and the Little Brown Bat respond to stress relative to closely-related smaller, shorter-lived species; and how their unique evolutionary histories have led to genetic adaptations that enhance their stress response and lower their per-cell cancer risk. Using primary cell culture models and functional genomics, I aim to explore next how differences in transcritomic and epigenetic responses to stress and aging contribute to differences in lifespan.

# RESEARCH EXPERIENCE \hrulefill

_Graduate Research Assistant_, Vincent J Lynch, University of Chicago \hfill __2016 - 2020__

> Studying Peto's Paradox and the duplication of tumor suppressor genes in large, long-lived species such as the African Elephant (_Loxodonta africana_), the Bowhead Whale (_Balaena mysticetus_), and the Little Brown Bat (_Myotis lucifugus_). The project involves searching for tumor suppressor homologues in other genomes using a custom Reciprocal Best-Hit BLAT pipeline I designed and programmed, followed by functional characterization of functional duplicates _in cellula_.  
> Developed a clade of recently-diverged bats as a model for Peto's Paradox research.  
> Mentored various undergraduate and graduate students rotating in the lab. As students all worked on subsets of my project, a major mentorship component was frequent informal journal clubs of papers related to our work. Additionally, students were all taught both basic skills like cell culture, and advanced skills like qPCR, Western blotting, and flow cytometry.  

_Rotation_, Alex Ruthenberg, University of Chicago \hfill __Summer 2016__

> Worked on optimizing an Internally Calibrated ChIP (ICeChip) methodology in _C. elegans_ to study H3K4me3 patterns at the onset of sexual maturity. 

_Research Assistant_, Vera Gorbunova and Andrei Seluanov, \hfill __January 2014 - __  
University of Rochester \hfill __May 2015__

> Analyzed the oxidative stress tolerance across various rodent species by culturing cells in high and low oxygen condition, using statistical analysis of growth rates to determine tolerance. Studied the effects of MEF SIRT6-KO cells in cancer cultures compared to wild-type MEF, and the role of the ADP-ribosylation function of SIRT6 in tumorigenesis. Created self-assembly hydrogels using hyaluronic acid derived from naked mole rat cells, and experimented with their use in maintaining 3D cell cultures, especially in the context of cancer and pluripotent stem cells. Studied the role played by RHAMM in the cancer resistance of the naked mole rat (_Heterocephalus glaber_).
