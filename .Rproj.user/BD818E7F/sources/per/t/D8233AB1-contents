# Updates since Qualifying Exam  

# __Aim 1__ Identification of Gene Duplications in _Paenungulata_, _Chiroptera_, and _Balaenidae_ using Reciprocal Best-Hit BLAT  

\indent I identified a bug in the pipeline that results in concatenations of segmental duplicates into a single hit call. During the time that it took to resolve the bug, I made two additional improvements to my pipeline: first, I implemented a method to optimize forward and reverse BLAT search parameters based on an initial test set of known 1-to-1 and 1-to-many query sequences. The second alteration involved changing the query set. Rather than using a set of consensus protein sequences for each gene based on RefSeq annotations, I used UniProtKB's hg38 proteome (UniProtKB Acc: _UP000005640_) as a foundation for sequnce queries.  

\indent I have rerun my Reciprocal Best-Hit BLAT pipeline on genomes for the African Elephant (_loxAfr3_), Rock Hyrax (_proCap1_), West Indian Manatee (_triMan1_), Aardvark (_oryAfe1_), 9-Banded Armadillo (_dasNov3_), and the Lesser Hedgehog Tenrec (_echTel2_); the results are summarized in Figures 1 & 2.  

```{r, echo=F, fig.align="center"}
fig1 <- afrotheria.hits %>% 
  ggtexttable(rows = NULL, theme = ttheme("mBlue", base_size = 8))
fig1.desc <- ggparagraph("Figure 1. Summary of results from RecBlat Search.",
                         size = 10)
fig1
```
  
```{r, echo=F, fig.align="center"}
fig1.desc
```

\indent I culled from this list oderant receptors (which are known to be greatly expanded in Elephants, and would represent an overwhelming increase in the run time); riboproteins and zinc finger proteins (as the identity between distinct proteins are quite high, meaning that the search parameters for these would need to be more rigorous than for other protein families); and any uncharacterized proteins and protein fragments.  

\indent Additionally I developed a statistic, called _Effective Copy Number by Coverage_ (ECNC) that corrects the copy number of hits that are fragmented across contigs by calculating the average coverage of the query in the genome. Specifically, it is defined as the number of times a nucleotide of the query is observed in any reciprocal best-hit for the query, divided by the number of nucleotides from the query observed across all hits in the genome. Mathematically, this can be written as:  

$$ ECNC = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{l} C_n}{\sum_{n=1}^{l} bool(C_n)}$$
where $n$ is a given nucleotide in the query, $l$ is the total length of the query, $C_n$ is the number of instances that $n$ is present within a reciprocal best hit, and $bool(C_n)$ is 1 if $C_n > 0$ or 0 if $C_n = 0$. 


\indent The final filtering step involves intersecting the resulting BED file of all hits with available RNA-seq and gene prediction tracks, to obtain a final count of hits supported by orthogonal lines of evidence. A duplicated gene is defined as any gene with at least 2 hits whose functionality are supported by the lines of evidence; and which has an ECNC greater than or equal to 1.5.  

\indent I then used WebGestalt to perform an overrepresentation analysis with the duplicated genes, using the "Reactome Pathways" GO-term dataset. The results indicate that duplicates in the African Elephant are enriched in pathways related to "Cellular Response to Stress" and the APC/CDC20 complex that regulates M-Phase (Fig 2a). Within these two categories, there are various instances of genes that are present in higher copy number in the African Elephant relative to the Hyrax and the Manatee, listed in Figure 2b.

\indent I am refining the parameters for searching in order to better resolve highly similar members of the same family, such as the Protocadherins and Hox family genes. Once I develop a set of empirically-determined parameters that can accurately tease apart these members, the data can be incoporated into past and future searches to resolve many-to-1 and many-to-many mapping situations. Once this is completed, I will move on to running my pipeline on other clades, including Primates (serves as a good baseline control and an outgroup within Afrotheria to the Paenungulates); Chiroptera (15 genomes, described in Aim 4); and Balaenidae (which has new genomes available since 2018) [@rnason2018wholegenome].

\indent During my qualifying exam, I presented the data in Figure 3A-G. In order to probe the pathways involved (Fig 3A), I have ordered plasmids from AddGene that contain the inserts described in Figure 4. The overarching goal in the selection of plasmids was to leverage available dominant negative and non-CDKN2C-interacting cell cycle proteins to probe the interactions of the CDKN2C retrogen in the context of it's canonical cell cycle roles. If the phenotype of the retrogene is identical to the canonical gene, the phenotypes described in Figure 4 will be observed.

## __Aim 3__  Characterization of UCHl3 Duplicates in various long-lived organisms  

\indent Reciprocal-Best-Hit sequences across all vertebrate species on UCSC's Genome Browser for UCHL3 have been collected. Further work on this aim is on hold as per the planned timeline until 2019.  

## __Aim 4__  Characterization of TP53 Duplicates in _Chiroptera_  

\indent Work on Aim 4 has begun ahead of schedule, due to the assembly of a collection of phylogenically diverse bat cells before schedule, and the arrival of an undergraduate student in the lab (Eric Chen, a rising 2nd year in the Biology department) who has assisted me in the "Identification via Reciprocal Best-Hit BLAT" and "RT-qPCR" facets of the project. The results of the Reciprocal Best-Hit BLAT search for TP53 across the 15 published bat genomes is shown in Figure 5. Of all the duplicates, only the two copies of TP53 in _Myotis lucifugus_ show transcriptional activity according to public RNA-seq databases.

\indent I have begun stress-testing the cells in my collection by treating them with various doses of paraquat (mitochondrial oxidative stress), doxorubicin (double-strand breaks), nutlin-3a (MDM2 inhibition leading to TP53 activation), and tunicamycin (ER UPR stress) and assessing the cells' viability, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis rates using the ApoToxGlo kit from Promega. The results of the first replicate of Paraquat treatment of all cells are shown in Figure 6A. The results thus far are in line with our expectations for a species with a second copy of TP53: the apoptosis response curve for _Myotis lucifugus_ is shifted down for lower doses of paraquat compared to its most-closely related relatives, _M. evotis_ and _M. thysanodes_. In Figure 6B, one can see that at 24 hours, there is still an elevated viability signal at the most reponsive dose of paraquat; at 48 hours, however, there is a dip in viability, but the relative viability between _M. lucifugus_ and _M. evotis_ remains similar; the difference, however, between the apoptosis rates in _M. lucifugus_ and the others are clear. _M. evotis_ also has an apoptotic response at 48hr, but at the much higher dose of 100uM. _M. thysanodes_ has in turn a cytotoxic response to the 7.5uM dose of paraquat. To further characterize these responses, I have begun to quantitatively assay ROS production and antioxidant response in these cells simultaneously by multiplexing a Dual Luciferase Assay using the reporter pGL4.37[luc2P/ARE/Hygro] (containing four Antioxidant-Response Elements driving luciferase expression); with a fluorometric ROS reporter called CellROX Orange.  

\indent With the RT-qPCR and the aforementioned assays underway, the next steps are to design two anti-TP53 siRNAs for _Myotis lucifugus_ (one general to both copies, and one specific to either copy) to see how ablation of TP53 - either generally or of the retrocopy - affects the cells' response to chemical stressors. Additionally, before I can perform gene tree reconcilliation and date the emergence of the retrogenes, we would like to sequence gaps that exist in the sequence of one of the two full-length TP53 loci to maximize the sequence information we have.

Shaded regions around each line represent 95% confidence intervals of the data. Of note is that relative to the Apoptosis peak of M.lucifugus at 48hr, M.evotis (which is the next-closest species) has a lower apoptosis threshold for paraquat, and the other species have a marked preference for cytotoxic responses; this extra sensitivity to stress may be explained by this species having two active copies of TP53. B) Boxplot representation of the data at the dosage highlighted in 6A, which represents the most responsive dose for Myotis lucifugus.
