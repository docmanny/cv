# EDUCATION

*University of Chicago*, Ph.D. Human Genetics \hfill Present

> Laboratory of: Vincent J Lynch, Department of Human Genetics  
> Dissertation title: *The Role of Gene Duplicates in Resolving Peto's Paradox in Elephants and Bats*  
> Committee Members: Marcelo Nobrega, Joseph Thorton, Yang Li, Vincent J Lynch  

*University of Rochester*, B.S. Biology, Molecular Genetics \hfill 2015

*University of Rochester*, B.A. Chemistry \hfill 2015


# RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

*Graduate Research Assistant, Vincent J Lynch, University of Chicago* \hfill Fall 2016-Present  

> Studying Peto's Paradox and the duplication of tumor suppressor genes in large, long-lived species such as the African Elephant (*Loxodonta africana*), the Bowhead Whale (*Balaena mysticetus*), and the Little Brown Bat (*Myotis lucifugus*). The project involves searching for tumor suppressor homologues in other genomes using a custom Reciprocal Best-Hit BLAT pipeline I designed and programmed, followed by functional characterization of functional duplicates *in cellula*.  
> Mentored various undergraduate and graduate students rotating in the lab. As students all worked on subsets of my project, a major mentorship component was frequent informal journal clubs of papers related to our work. Additionally, students were all taught both basic skills like cell culture, and advanced skills like qPCR, Western blotting, and flow cytometry.  

*Rotation, Alex Ruthenberg, University of Chicago* \hfill Summer 2016  

> Worked on transfering an Internally Calibrated ChIP (ICeChip) methodology to *C. elegans* to study H3K4me3 patterns at the onset of sexual maturity. 

*Research Assistant, Vera Gorbunova and Andrei Seluanov, University of Rochester* \hfill January 2014 - May 2015

> Analyzed the oxidative stress tolerance across various rodent species by culturing cells in high and low oxygen condition, using statistical analysis of growth rates to determine tolerance. Studied the effects of MEF SIRT6-KO cells in cancer cultures compared to wild-type MEF, and the role of the ADP-ribosylation function of SIRT6 in tumorigenesis. Created self-assembly hydrogels using hyaluronic acid derived from naked mole rat cells, and experimented with their use in maintaining 3D cell cultures, especially in the context of cancer and pluripotent stem cells. Studied the role played by RHAMM in the cancer resistance of the naked mole rat (heterocephalus glaber).

*Teaching Assistant, BIOS 21306 Human Genetics and Evolution, University of Chicago* \hfill Winter 2017

> Undergraduate course focusing on historic and modern advances in our understanding of human genetics at various scales. In addition to keeping attendance and organizing the course, he taught a lesson on classic and modern techniques for sequencing DNA & RNA; detecting epigenetic modifications in the genome; and on detecting signatures of selection in the genome.  

*Teaching Assistant, CHM 210H Honors Organic Chemistry Lab, University of Rochester* \hfill Spring 2013

> Assisted in the instruction of the lab lecture, lead workshop-style discussions to create the experimental procedures for the labs with students. Oversaw and administered the proper functioning of the lab. Aided and taught students, as well as assessed them for quality work and analytic skills in lab work and in lab reports.

*Teaching Assistant, CHM 173Q Freshman Organic Chemistry Lab, University of Rochester* \hfill Fall 2012

>Oversaw an organic chemistry lab of 16 freshmen students, grading reports and ensuring the proper functioning of the lab. Ran weekly workshops and lectures for students to design their experiments for the week.
